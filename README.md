In England, the currency is pound sterling and pence. There are eight coins in circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £ 1 (100p) and £ 2 (200p). £ 2 can be performed as follows: 1 × £ 1 + 1 × 50p + 2 × 20p + 1 × 5p + 1 × 2p + 3 × 1p
How many different ways can I make £ 2 using any number of coins? Propose a solution code for the task (or link to the repository)
